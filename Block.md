A block that when a certain key is pressed it separates from the rest of the robot

Im not talking about the joint tool thats only accessible in construction mode, im talking about a way to separate the robot into different parts without the need to return to the construction mode

It would be something similar to the explosive bolt of TerraTech

Also i would like a way to reconnect the separated parts

maybe adding a gear track, basicly a block with room for a gear to mesh on it
for things like a sliding thing

Suspension. That's it. Springs, wheel cussioning. That's all.
Also pressure! Like cannons that grab objects and after gaining enough pressure  you can release it, launching the object towards a target/objective.

more gears

i think we need more gears because you can't do many combinations, for example you can't do a ratio of 4 to 1 by connecting an 8 tooth gear to a 32 tooth gear, you pretty stuck with their size. Also, I've not found a simple way todo planetary gear sets / connecting gears to the larger gears only fit the 8 tooth gears

Gyroscopes that you can set the settings of, So you can make a motor bike bot that can do wheelys but not tip other
