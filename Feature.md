Allow us to spawn multiple bots, so you can have like a group of autonomous bots like here https://youtu.be/G1t4M2XnIhI

When selecting multiple pistons with equal length it'd be nice to be able to resize them all at once instead of one by one. Notice how only the one on the left has the bubble above it.

Multiple of the same type would also be nice

Would love to have an option where the joint connects on blocks instead of always being middle point
Without having to use rods due to rods being incompatible with some objects.

Could the game have an option to automatically save your design when you press "Ship it!"? Maybe a checkbox would be sufficent.

I also think it would be fun to have a camera or more on your robot and have an option to use the camera as the game's camera. 

Camera mode that you can select to see trough the eyes of your robot

In some games you can pause time when in photomode/freecam so you can get a better look at something before it ends
