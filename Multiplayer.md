Ok, here's a an idea - Multiplayer challenges, essentially the same as normal challenges, but it's in the format of a race or battle between you and your friends.
So, like "Who can deliver the sandwich first?" or "Disassemble your opponent's sandwich before they disassemble your sandwich."

If there is a limit of players in a RoboCo server (Let's say a limit of 16 players), then each build area can have a limit of 1 player (Build areas could also be called workshops) and then each server could have at least 16 workshops. If a workshop is taken by a player then another person can come up to the occupied workshop and send an invite asking if they can do a Co-op build. The Co-op build will just be 2 players in one build zone.
