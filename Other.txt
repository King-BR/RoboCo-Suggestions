Discord rich presence
Show what challenge someone is doing, how long they've spent on it and maybe some other things like property damage and failed attempts

API for the game

@robo_luke#1416 asked me on how i would use the API if they made it so here i am

I would use the API to create a discord bot (and a website maybe?) to get player stats, game statistics, etc...

Here are some sugestions for the API

The things marked with a ? are optional or for the future (because they don't exist yet or because they are difficult to do)

> Get player stats:
total games played, current status (online, offline, playing sandbox or challenges), achievements, total challenges completed (separated values for completed with or without all bonus and/or secret objectives completed)

> Get game data info:
information about the blocks (weight, size, function, etc...), challenges info (map name, main objective, bonus objectives, hint for secret objectives?)

> Workshop info?:
user created maps (author, map name, description, if its a challenge or sandbox map, in case of challenge map a list of the objectives), user created robots (author, robot name, description, blocks used), user created constructs? (author, description, blocks used)

> Robot save files?:
> Similar to workshop info but the we provide a file and the API returns the file data
get the thumbnail, author, description, blocks used, a secure save file? (to prevent virus and/or malwares)

Image-based savefiles such as in Trailmakers. That could lead to safer sharing of robots maybe?
They're openly sharing and I don't think there's been any issues so far.
