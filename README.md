# Some cool title

Suggestions compiled from the [official RoboCo Discord server](https://discord.gg/DX8vCZN)

I made this to make it easier for the dev team to see the suggestions without having to search on the discord channel in the middle of repeated suggestions, comments, off-topic, etc...

If you have another sugestion or i forgot to put your suggestion you can create an [issue](https://github.com/King-BR/RoboCo-Suggestions/issues) or add it with a [pull request](https://github.com/King-BR/RoboCo-Suggestions/pulls)
